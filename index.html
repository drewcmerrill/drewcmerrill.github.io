          Hey there! My name is Drew Merrill and I'm a software engineer
          currently working for General Dynamics Mission Systems in Scottsdale,
          Arizona. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Arizona State University in
          2021 with a degree in Computer Science and am currently pursuing my
          master degree in Computer Science (Big Data Systems) from ASU and am
          expecting to graduate in May of 2024. Outside of school and work I'm
          passionate about pursuing my hobbies which include: personal coding
          projects, sand volleyball, piano, reading, board games, or trying to
          complete my 9,000 piece puzzle (the passion on this one has long since
          turned to dispair). I created this website to teach myself web
          development and use it as a showcase for my accomplishments.
